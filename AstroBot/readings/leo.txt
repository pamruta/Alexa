You generally tend to be intellectually curious, with many interests that you're always trying to learn more about. Today, however, you could have a subject in mind you're dying to research - but you'll be unable to find any books, articles, websites, etc., no matter how many libraries you try or databases you explore. Don't bother with it today. You'll only succeed in frustrating yourself. Instead, watch an old TV comedy rerun. At least you'll get a few laughs!
