Someone close to you might be uncharacteristically silent today. Something is bothering them terribly, and they don't seem to want to talk about it. You'll be willing to listen or to assist in any way, but don't try to coax your friend into sharing. Use your intuition to sense what's going on, and do what's necessary to alleviate the situation without asking. Believe me, your efforts won't go unnoticed or unappreciated!
