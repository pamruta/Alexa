Take care that you don't exhaust yourself. You could be doing too much for others at this busy time in everyone's life. Your kind heart and generous nature often has you saying "yes" to requests when you should be saying "no." Today you might want to rethink the obligations you have taken on. Think of it this way: you are not saying "no" to someone else, but rather saying "yes" to yourself!
