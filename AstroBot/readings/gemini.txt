Tender loving care is what's prescribed for someone in your family. It may be you, or someone else living in your house. Offer a bowl of soup and some mineral water, but beyond that try and stay out of the way. Sometimes uninterrupted quiet is the best cure-all. And you could use a bit of this cure yourself. Why not curl up in bed with a good book? Even if it is the middle of the day, draw the shades and pretend it is nighttime.
